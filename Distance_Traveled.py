# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, 
# the distance that a car travels down the 
# interstate can be calculated with the following
# formula: Distance = Speed * Time
# A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. 
# Write a program that displays the following:
# The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 12 hours
speed = 60
distance = 60 * 5
print('In 5 hours, the car has traveled', distance)
distance = 60 * 8
print('In 8 hours, the car has traveled', distance)
distance = 60 * 12
print('In 12 hours, the car has traveled', distance)
